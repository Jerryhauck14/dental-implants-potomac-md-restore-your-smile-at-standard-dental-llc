Dental implants are small titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. Once healed, they provide a secure foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures. This makes implants a permanent, durable, and natural-feeling solution compared to traditional dentures or removable bridges.
